Narwhal XULRunner Engine
========================
Setup
-----
    tusk install narwhal-xulrunner
Usage
-----
    NARWHAL_ENGINE=xulrunner narwhal
Notes
-----
* Javascript shell
If xulrunner statrup takes a while telnet connection to it will fail so there will be no js shell,
but it's still possible to get js shell by manually connecting to the xulrunner app:
    <code>telnet localhost 4747</code>
